                The user acknowledges that the nature of the Bayn
                platform&apos;s commitment is simply to provide electronic
                support tools, by providing the dealer&apos;s own electronic
                account, enabling him to present his products to consumers, and
                to show a group of influencers with whom the store can
                collaborate. Therefore, what the Bayn platform does is merely to
                link a group of parties, whether they (the merchant and the
                consumer), (the consumer and the service providers - the
                services of the third party) or (the merchant and the

                not liable for the consequences arising therefrom.
